This should contain everything to re-create this bzr2git mirror.

Create a new git repo somewhere: `git init .`

Copy `git/config` and `git/description` from this branch
into `.git/config` and `.git/description` respectively.

Run `git remote update` and `git pull` should get you running.
Copy `git/refs/heads/` as well to get the branches "checked out" locally.
